<blockquote><p>Plans are worthless, but planning is everything. There is a very
great distinction because when you are planning for an emergency you
must start with this one thing: the very definition of “emergency”
is that it is unexpected, therefore it is not going to happen the
way you are planning.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Past</h1>
<p>My main focus was working on the sample implementation for SRFI-167
and SRFI-168 along the continued work on a real implementation on top
of WiredTiger using (Chez Akku) Arew Scheme. I managed to get together
a release dubbed 0.1.1, that you can try using the following command:</p>
<blockquote><p>git clone <a href="https://github.com/scheme-live/srfi-167-and-168-tutorial">https://github.com/scheme-live/srfi-167-and-168-tutorial</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The standardization process is kicking and more people got involved by
sharing wishes, bug reports and in general valuable positive and
negative feedbacks. My talk on this subject to <a href="https://icfp19.sigplan.org/track/scheme-2019-papers">Scheme
Workshop</a> was
accepted. I would have liked write and submit a full paper about it, I
mostly failed. I started writing a tutorial (book?) about the Ordered
Key-Value Store that is called <a href="/around.20190624v1.pdf">Around Multi-Model
Database</a>.</p>
<p>I drew <a href="https://github.com/awesome-data-distribution/datae/issues">a
plan</a> in
the sand of github about datae.</p>
<p>I put together some ideas about <a href="https://github.com/scheme-live/peer-to-peer-network">peer-to-peer
networks</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/scheme-live/sin">functional package manager</a>.</p>
<p>Also, schemedoc launched <a href="https://github.com/schemedoc/awesome-scheme/">Awesome
Scheme</a>.</p>
<p>I got involved in some W3C mailling list related to RDF and AI.</p>
<p>At last, I got some energy to read things and listen to Noam Chomsky.</p>
<p>I found especially interesting the text entitled: <a href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/smalltalk.html">Design Principles
Behind
Smalltalk</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a first quote about their "scientifical" approach to design
systems:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our work has followed a two- to four-year cycle that can be seen to
parallel the scientific method:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Build an application program within the current system (make an
observation)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Based on that experience, redesign the language (formulate a
theory)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Build a new system based on the new design (make a prediction that
can be tested)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Smalltalk-80 system marks our fifth time through this cycle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is another about the relation between tools, individual
accomplishments and how to achieve them:</p>
<blockquote><p>I'll start with a principle that is more social than technical and
that is largely responsible for the particular bias of the Smalltalk
project:</p>
<p>Personal Mastery: If a system is to serve the creative spirit, it
must be entirely comprehensible to a single individual.</p>
<p>The point here is that the human potential manifests itself in
individuals. To realize this potential, we must provide a medium
that can be mastered by a single individual. Any barrier that exists
between the user and some part of the system will eventually be a
barrier to creative expression. Any part of the system that cannot
be changed or that is not sufficiently general is a likely source of
impediment. If one part of the system works differently from all the
rest, that part will require additional effort to control. Such an
added burden may detract from the final result and will inhibit
future endeavors in that area. We can thus infer a general principle
of design:</p>
<p>Good Design: A system should be built with a minimum set of
unchangeable parts; those parts should be as general as possible;
and all parts of the system should be held in a uniform framework.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like the spirit of Scheme or <a href="http://worrydream.com/">worrydream.com</a>.</p>
<p>I also liked the <a href="http://metamodular.com/Common-Lisp/lispos.html">lisp os
text</a>. Here is the
part that echoed the most with my work:</p>
<blockquote><p>Object store based on tags</p>
<p>Instead of a hierarchical file system, we propose an object store
which can contain any objects. If a file (i.e. a sequence of bytes)
is desired, it would be stored as an array of bytes.</p>
<p>Instead of organizing the objects into a hierarchy, objects in the
store can optionally be associated with an arbitrary number of
tags. These tags are key/value pairs, such as for example the date
of creation of the archive entry, the creator (a user) of the
archive entry, and the access permissions for the entry. Notice that
tags are not properties of the objects themselves, but only of the
archive entry that allows an object to be accessed. Some tags might
be derived from the contents of the object being stored such as the
sender or the date of an email message. It should be possible to
accomplish most searches of the store without accessing the objects
themselves, but only the tags. Occasionally, contents must be
accessed such as when a raw search of the contents of a text is
wanted.</p>
<p>It is sometimes desirable to group related objects together as with
directories of current operating systems. Should a user want such a
group, it would simply be another object (say instances of the class
directory) in the store. Users who can not adapt to a
non-hierarchical organization can even store such directories as one
of the objects inside another directory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the idea of building a Scheme operating system is beautiful.  I
don't have enough time for it. Much inspiration can be taken from
existing projects like GNU Guix,
<a href="https://github.com/froggey/Mezzano">Mezzano</a> or Unikernels...</p>
<p>Another interesting read is: <a href="https://cra.org/ccc/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/02/Accelerating-Science-Whitepaper-CCC-Final2.pdf">Accelerating Science: A Computing
Research
Agenda</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Accelerating Science: The Value Proposition</p>
<p>Cognitive tools for acclerating science could lead to dramatic
increases in scientific productivity by increasing efficiency of the
key steps in scientific process, and in the quality of science that
is carried out (by reducing error, enhancing reproducibility), allow
scientific treatment of topics that were previously impossible to
address, and enable new modes of discovery that leverage large
amounts of data, knowledge, and automated inference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>... and allow effective learning.</p>
<h1>Present and Future</h1>
<p>The sample implementation for SRFI-167 in particular needs more love.
It happens that I need it, for some future projects. Among others I
use it in emacs-like editor and I might rely on it in the functional
package manager. I have still things to figure.  It seems like I am
trying to shoehorn it, especially in the case of the functional
package manager. In the case of the editor, it is less likely to be a
mistake because indeed it is helpful and implements separation of
concerns like Model-View-Controler. Having the same data-structure
everywhere is helpful and it is more powerful than a hash-table or
struct as it allow to easily do introspection to ease debugging.</p>
<p>While I was excited by datae as a demonstration of change-request
mechanic over structured data that is bigger than memory. I was
thinking that it might lead to making a living out-of-it with grants,
community support or consulting. Getting together that software with
100% support of SPARQL is not impossible. The question is do I really
want to invest my time in this particular project?  At some point,
"maybe" is not anymore an acceptable answer. In the meantime, I will
just put it on "standby" mode.</p>
<p>I am discussing a possible relicencing of Arew into something dubbed
business-friendly most likely Apache 2.0. This will lead to a split of
the project into two components. The first will remain in Arew and
will be dedicated to <a href="https://r7rs.org">R7RS</a> support and moar.  The
second repository will be prolly called babelia and will be licensed
in a fork of the Affero GPL licence that is more humane, more sensible
to the challenges faced by the anthorposcene.</p>
<p>I got a better idea about my Personal Knowledge Base project or if you
prefer my Personal Assistant or Research Assistant. To quote Ronald
J. Brachman:</p>
<blockquote><p>Can we have realistically useful Knowledge Base that is designed in
the absence of specific intended applications?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Otherwise said, I need an application of the application (!) to be
able to dogfood the idea. I think studying Artificial Intelligence and
its history is a good subject of study, in particular I need to learn
more about non-monotoic logic and ordinal number systems.</p>
