	    <div><h1>2017/01/01 - Getting Started With State of the Art Frontend Development</h1>
<p>Nowdays I do a mix of Python system programming and Web UI
developements using Javascript (scss, backbone, classy, bootstrap).</p>
<p>I've diven a bit into state of the of the modern way of doing things,
prolly synonymous of state of the art. There is in my opinion three
main libraries that fight for the spotlight:</p>
<ul>
<li>Angular, which is basically a dead project</li>
<li>React/Redux, the most popular solution, but
it's very modular.</li>
<li>Vue, is kind of inspired from react/redux,
similarly it's very modular but the development
is mostly centralized.</li>
</ul>
<p>All three of them have a common point which is <code>diff</code>+<code>patch</code>
algorithms. That algorithm allows to declare the way the html should
look in its entierity and the algorithm make it happen in the
rendering graph by updating/remove/adding rendering nodes (which are
in the case of webdev, most of the time: DOM objects).</p>
<p>I kept that idea. I created bindings on top of snabbdom.js and
built what I could build, first getting inspiration from elm
and redux to come up with the most minimald and most versatile
framework for building web apps.</p>
<p>The canvas offered by this framework is summed by the following
<code>mount</code> procedure:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">define </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">mount</span> <span class="nv">container</span> <span class="nv">init</span> <span class="nv">view</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="s">&quot;Mount in node from the DOM named CONTAINER, the result of the state</span>
<span class="s">returned by INIT passed to VIEW. VIEW must return pseudo sxml where</span>
<span class="s">\&quot;on-fu\&quot; attributes (where fu is DOM event name) are associated with</span>
<span class="s">action lambdas. An action looks like the following:</span>

<span class="s">   (define (button-clicked state spawn)</span>
<span class="s">     (lambda (event)</span>
<span class="s">       (+ 1 state)))</span>

<span class="s">In the above STATE is the current state. SPAWN allows to create</span>
<span class="s">a new green thread. When the action returns the new state, the</span>
<span class="s">VIEW procedure is called again with the new state.</span>

<span class="s">A minimal VIEW procedure looks like the following:</span>

<span class="s">   (define (view state)</span>
<span class="s">     `(button (@ (on-click . ,button-clicked)) ,state))</span>

<span class="s">A minimal INIT procedure looks like the following:</span>

<span class="s">   (define (init) 1)</span>

<span class="s">That&#39;s all folks!</span>
<span class="s">&quot;</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">let </span><span class="p">((</span><span class="nf">state</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">init</span><span class="p">)))</span>  <span class="c1">;; init state</span>
    <span class="c1">;; create a procedure that allows to create new green threads</span>

<p>Basically, it says that <code>INIT</code> procedure produce a seed state
passed to <code>VIEW</code> which renders the first version of the graph
scene. A node from the graph scene fires an event, user specified
callbacks are which are called action procedures which basically
takes everything they need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>do ajax without blocking using an imperative syntax (via call/cc)</li>
<li>spawn new green thread</li>
<li>update the state</li>
</ul>
<p>That's where will land the business code.</p>
<p>The <code>VIEW</code> procedure contains the UI code.</p>
