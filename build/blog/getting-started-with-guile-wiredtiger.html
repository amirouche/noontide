	    <div><h1>2016/01/01 - Getting started with guile-wiredtiger</h1>
<p>guile-wiredtiger is a library binding wiredtiger which is database
library. I like it because I don't like/master SQL. Other people use
it to build real databases like mongodb. Myself I've done one or two
toy projects using it like planetplanet clone.</p>
<p>wiredtiger is low level compared to a SQL database.</p>
<p>I can't convince you to use it, but I can show you how it works.</p>
<h3>Ground zero</h3>
<p>Download
<a href="http://source.wiredtiger.com/releases/wiredtiger-2.6.1.tar.bz2">wiredtiger 2.6.1</a>
and install it using the usual cli dance. Then retrieve wiredtiger
repository with git:</p>

<div><pre>git clone https://git.framasoft.org/a-guile-mind/guile-wiredtiger.git</pre></div>
<p>Now go to guile-wiredtiger directory and fire a REPL using the following command:</p>

<div><pre>guile -L .</pre></div>
<p>Mind the dot.</p>
<h3>Use wiredtiger</h3>
<p>Inside the REPL import the wiredtiger module:</p>

<div><pre>scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (use-modules (wiredtiger))</pre></div>
<h3>Open a connection</h3>
<p>Open a connection against a directory say /tmp/wt:</p>

<div><pre>scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (mkdir "/tmp/wt")
scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (define connection (connection-open "/tmp/wt" "create"))</pre></div>
<p>It's always safe to open a connection against a directory using the create argument even if there is already a database inside that directory.</p>
<p>a <connection> is thread-safe.</p>
<h3>Open a session</h3>
<p>To jump to using the database you have to open a session:</p>

<div><pre>scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (define session (session-open connection))</pre></div>
<p>a <session> is not thread-safe.</p>
<h3>Create a table</h3>
<p>wiredtiger is nosql but has a concept of table. It's a two columns
layout with sub-columns. The first master column is the key. The
second master column is the value.</p>
<p>This dichotomy is useful because the table is automatically ordered
using the what is stored in the key.</p>
<p>Let's create simple table with a single string sub-column key, and a
single string sub-column value. Yes, columns are typed. Without
further addo:</p>

<div><pre>scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (session-create session "table:kv" "key_format=S,value_format=S,columns=(k,v)")</pre></div>
<p>It's safe to session-create a table even if it already exists in the database.</p>
<p>Here we created a table named kv as specified above. The key
sub-column is named k and the value sub-column is named v.</p>
<p>Naming columns is optional but required if you want to build indices.
Create an index</p>
<p>To create an index we use the same session-create procedure with
another configuration string.</p>
<p>Say, we want to invert k sub-column with v sub-column ie. create an
index table where the key single sub-column is v from kv table. We can
use the following command:</p>

<div><pre>scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (session-create session "index:kv:inverse" "columns=(v)")</pre></div>
<p>This instruct wiredtiger to add a row to index:kv:inverse table
everytime a row is added to table:kv where the key single column
content is the content of the column named v in table:kv row.</p>
<p>The index is always synchronized with the reference table for updates,
deletes and inserts.</p>
<h3>Getting started with cursors</h3>
<h4>Insert</h4>
<p>A <cursor> is the way to search, navigate, insert and update a
table. This is also used to search and navigate index tables.</p>
<p>Let's open a <cursor> on table:kv:</p>

<div><pre>scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (define cursor (cursor-open session "table:kv"))</pre></div>
<p>Let's add a record ie. a key/value pair inside the table:</p>

<div><pre>scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (cursor-key-set cursor "key")
$4 = 0
scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (cursor-value-set cursor "value")
$5 = 0
scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (cursor-insert cursor)
$6 = #t</pre></div>
<p>This is bit involving for our simple case of single sub-columns configuration. Define a procedure to add a record with a single procedure:</p>

<div><pre>(define (cursor-insert* cursor key value)
  (cursor-key-set cursor key)
  (cursor-value-set cursor value)
  (cursor-insert cursor))</pre></div>
<p>And put it to good use:</p>

<div><pre>scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (cursor-insert* cursor "another" "record"))
$7 = #t
scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (cursor-insert* cursor "something" "else")
$8 = #t</pre></div>
<h4>Search</h4>
<p>To look into the table, you also have to use the wiredtiger primitive cursor-key-set followed by cursor-search or cursor-search-near.</p>
<p>For instance, we can do:</p>

<div><pre>scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (cursor-key-set cursor "key")
$10 = 0
scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (cursor-search cursor)
$11 = #t
scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (cursor-value-ref cursor)
$12 = ("value")</pre></div>
<p>The return value of cursor-value-ref is a list because there might be
several sub-columns in a master column. Similarly cursor-key-ref
returns a list:</p>

<div><pre>scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (cursor-key-ref cursor)
$13 = ("key")</pre></div>
<p>Unsuprisingly this returns key because the cursor was positioned at
that key using search. This is not a relevant call to do after
cursor-search because cursor-search does an exact match of the key or
match nothing. This is not the case of cursor-search-near which use
some heuristic to find the nearest key. We will study this, but first
let's define cursor-search-near star:</p>

<div><pre>(define (cursor-search-near* cursor key)
  (cursor-key-set cursor key)
  (cursor-search-near cursor))</pre></div>
<p>And try it:</p>

<div><pre>scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (cursor-search-near* cursor "ke")
$14 = 1
scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (cursor-key-ref cursor)
$15 = ("key")</pre></div>
<p>As you can see cursor-search-near star ie. cursor-search-near returns 1
instead of true or false like cursor-search. cursor-search-near is
very useful. I warmly recommend you have a look at its documentation.
Navigate</p>
<p>We can verify that the table is correctly ordered. Remember we
inserted the following keys: key, another and something.</p>
<p>So in theory we should see them appearing in the alphabetic aka. the
lexicographic order.</p>
<p>Let's reset the cursor position and navigate the database:</p>

<div><pre>scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (cursor-reset cursor)
$21 = #t
scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (cursor-next cursor)
$22 = #t
scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (cursor-key-ref cursor)
$23 = ("another")
scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (cursor-next cursor)
$24 = #t
scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (cursor-key-ref cursor)
$25 = ("key")
scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (cursor-next cursor)
$26 = #t
scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (cursor-key-ref cursor)
$27 = ("something")</pre></div>
<p>All is good.</p>
<p>You can also mix cursor-search[-near] with cursor-next and
cursor-previous. Don't forget to read wiredtiger error output ;)</p>
<h4>Remove</h4>
<p>To remove a record, just set cursor's key content, an remove it using cursor-remove:</p>

<div><pre>scheme@(guile-user) [1]&gt; (cursor-key-set cursor "key")
$28 = 0
scheme@(guile-user) [1]&gt; (cursor-remove cursor)
$29 = #t</pre></div>
<p>Let's check that this code, is doing what it's supposed to be doing:</p>

<div><pre>scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (cursor-key-set cursor "key")
$30 = 0
scheme@(guile-user)&gt; (cursor-search cursor)
$31 = #f</pre></div>
<p>cursor-search returns false, which means the key is not found.</p>
<p>Try again with cursor-search-near star.</p>
</div>
